# Privacy

Pebbles is intentionally simple: everything you write stays on your device. There are no servers, analytics, or third-party trackers.

## Local-first data

Entries are stored in your browser's local storage. Clearing your browser data removes them permanently. Export anything important before wiping your storage or switching devices.

## No account required

You do not need to create an account or provide personal data. All features are available immediately after loading the page.

## Optional diagnostics

Anonymous performance metrics may be collected by the hosting platform to keep the service reliable. These metrics are aggregate and do not include the content of your entries.
