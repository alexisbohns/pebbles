_Last updated: October 24, 2025_

Pebbles is a personal reflection and journaling service provided by Pebblestones (“Pebbles”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Pebbles website, progressive web application, and related services (collectively, the “Services”). By creating an account, accessing, or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Eligibility

You may use the Services only if you are at least 16 years old, or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction, and are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.

## 2. Account Registration and Security

To access certain features, you must create an account and provide accurate, current, and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach. We may suspend or terminate your account if we suspect misuse.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Services solely for lawful, personal, and non-commercial purposes. You must not:

- Upload or share content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.
- Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Services.
- Use automated scripts or scraping tools to collect data from the Services without our prior written consent.

We reserve the right to remove content or suspend accounts that violate these Terms.

## 4. User Content and Ownership

You retain ownership of the content you add to the Services (“User Content”). By submitting User Content, you grant Pebbles a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, process, and display that content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Services. You are responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of your User Content.

## 5. Privacy

Our collection, use, and sharing of personal data are described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy). By using the Services, you consent to the processing of your personal data in accordance with that policy. You acknowledge that journaling entries may contain sensitive information; we recommend exercising discretion when recording personal details.

## 6. Health and Wellness Disclaimer

Pebbles is a self-reflection tool and is **not** a medical, psychological, or therapeutic service. It does not provide diagnosis, treatment, or medical advice. Always seek the guidance of qualified health professionals regarding mental or physical health concerns. Never disregard or delay seeking professional advice because of information available through the Services.

## 7. Service Changes and Availability

We continually refine the Services and may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time. We will attempt to provide notice of significant changes when practicable, but we are not obligated to maintain any specific functionality. We are not liable for any harm arising from service interruptions, maintenance, or technical issues.

## 8. Beta Features

We may offer preview, beta, or experimental features. Such features are provided “as is” without warranty, may be subject to additional terms, and may be withdrawn at any time.

## 9. Third-Party Services

The Services may integrate with third-party services (such as authentication providers or analytics). Use of third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies. Pebbles is not responsible for third-party content, services, or actions.

## 10. Fees

Pebbles may offer paid plans or optional premium features in the future. If you purchase a paid feature, you agree to pay the applicable fees and taxes. All payments are non-refundable except where required by law. We may change pricing upon reasonable notice.

## 11. Termination

You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms or if continued access poses risk to the Services or other users. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends immediately. Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will remain in effect, including ownership, disclaimers, and limitation of liability.

## 12. Disclaimers

THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DATA WILL BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE.

## 13. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PEBBLES AND ITS FOUNDERS, CONTRIBUTORS, AND PARTNERS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (B) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS OR YOUR DATA; OR (C) ANY CONTENT OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

## 14. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Pebbles, its directors, contributors, and affiliates from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the Services, your User Content, or violation of these Terms.

## 15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of France, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any dispute arising under these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Paris, France, unless applicable law requires otherwise.

## 16. Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date above. If the changes are material, we will provide notice through the Services or by other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
