# About Pebbles

Pebbles is a tiny journaling companion built to help you slow down, name what you feel, and discover kinder ways to react. It uses a classic CBT worksheet structure so you can revisit the situations that triggered you and decide how you would like to answer them next time.

## Why this project exists

I wanted a simple space that does not require an account, does not judge, and gently nudges me toward self-reflection. Pebbles grew out of that need and is shared so that anyone can benefit from the ritual.

## How Pebbles helps you

- Collect the key facts of a situation before it dissolves into feelings
- Externalize automatic thoughts instead of letting them loop in your head
- Map emotions and body sensations so you can recognize them sooner
- Experiment with alternative responses and prepare future-you

## Open source spirit

Pebbles is intentionally minimal and open. If you notice an issue or want to contribute ideas, check the project repository and feel free to open a pull request.
